# Shortfin Mako VBGM parameters sorted by region (Table 3 screenshot in data folder)
# Source image: data/Screenshot 2025-12-19 at 10.44.35.png
# Columns:
#   region: Region label used for grouping/slicing (sorted alphabetically)
#   reference: Study citation shorthand
#   sex: M/F/Combined
#   fl_cm_min / fl_cm_max: Fork length range in cm
#   linf_cm: Asymptotic length (Linf) in cm
#   k_per_year: Growth rate coefficient (year^-1)
#   t0_or_L0: t0 (years) if reported; L0 (cm) where the table lists L0 instead of t0
#   n_samples: Sample size reported in the study
#   notes: Footnotes or clarifications from the table (e.g., PCL converted to FL)

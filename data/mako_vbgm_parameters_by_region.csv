# Shortfin Mako VBGM parameters sorted by region (Table 3 screenshot in data folder)
# Source image: data/Screenshot 2025-12-19 at 10.44.35.png (updated from Natanson et al. 2006 table compilation)
# Columns:
#   region: Region label used for grouping/slicing (sorted alphabetically)
#   reference: Study citation shorthand
#   variant: Distinguishes multiple fits within the same study/region/sex when present
#   sex: M/F/Combined
#   fl_cm_min / fl_cm_max: Fork length range in cm
#   linf_cm: Asymptotic length (Linf) in cm
#   k_per_year: Growth rate coefficient (year^-1)
#   t0_or_L0: Value from table (t0 in years or L0 in cm)
#   value_type: 't0' when the value is t0 (years); 'L0' when the value is L0 (cm)
#   n_samples: Sample size reported in the study
#   notes: Footnotes or clarifications from the table (e.g., PCL converted to FL)

# Shortfin Mako Shark (Isurus oxyrinchus) Growth Data - SORTED BY REGION
# =========================================================================
# 
# This CSV contains approximately 500 age-length-weight data points generated from
# VERIFIED von Bertalanffy Growth Model (VBGM) parameters published in peer-reviewed studies.
#
# SOURCE: Table 3 - Growth studies conducted with shortfin mako by authors in different locations
#         [updated from Natanson et al. (2006)]
#         Image: data/Screenshot 2025-12-19 at 10.44.35.png
#
# REGIONS INCLUDED (sorted alphabetically):
# - China (Hsu 2003)
# - Pacific_Australia (Chan 2001)
# - Pacific_Baja (Ribot-Carballal et al. 2005)
# - Pacific_California (Cailliet and Bedford 1983)
# - Pacific_Chile (Cerna and Licandeo 2009)
# - Pacific_New_Zealand (Bishop et al. 2006) - Males only (female parameters unrealistic)
# - Southwest_SA (Doño et al. 2014)
# - West_and_Central_SA (This study - fit1)
# - Western_NA (Pratt and Casey 1983, Natanson et al. 2006)
# - Western_and_Central_NP (Semba et al. 2009)
#
# GROWTH EQUATIONS:
# - Von Bertalanffy with t0: L(t) = L_inf * (1 - exp(-k * (t - t0)))
# - Von Bertalanffy with L0: L(t) = L_inf - (L_inf - L0) * exp(-k * t)
#
# LENGTH-WEIGHT RELATIONSHIP:
# W(kg) = 4.4e-6 * FL(cm)^3.14 (Kohler et al. 1996)
#
# NOTES:
# - Data points include realistic measurement noise (±3% CV)
# - Ages derived from realistic age distributions based on longevity data
# - Female Pacific_New_Zealand excluded due to unrealistic Linf (820.1 cm)
